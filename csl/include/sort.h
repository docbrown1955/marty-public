/**
 * @file sort.h
 * @brief File containing custom sorting algorithms for expressions.
 * @details The std::sort algorithm is in principle more efficient but needs a
 * perfect total ordering between elements, otherwise it might (and will 
 * eventually) crash. Ordering between expressions is indeed well-formed, but 
 * only when expressions are cannonical (typically after a csl::DeepRefresh()
 * call). If an expression is not canonical, the ordering may be ill-formed and
 * std::sort() function crashes. We then define here algorithms (selection and 
 * merge sorts) that will not crash. For a canonical expression, these sorting
 * algorithms will have the same effect as std::sort(), may be slightly less
 * efficient. For non canonical ones, the sort is ill-defined but may still
 * be performed.
