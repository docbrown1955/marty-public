## Summary

`MARTY` is a C++ program automating perturbative calculations for beyond the Standard Model scenarios.
Models can be built using the C++ user interface. For any model, squared amplitudes and Wilson coefficients
can be calculated at the tree level or the one-loop level.

`MARTY` is a code generator. Analytical expressions, squared amplitudes or Wilson coefficients are
converted into C++ code in a self-contained library compiled independently of `MARTY`.
This code can therefore be used for numerical evaluation in different scenarios to perform a
phenomenological analysis.

More information can be found on the [website](https://marty.in2p3.fr).

## Get Started

In the following some possibilities to get started easily with `MARTY`, once installed, are presented. For installation instructions, see the following section.

## Installation

The following procedure is relevant since `MARTY-1.6`. To build and install older versions please refer to the [website](https://marty.in2p3.fr/download.html).

### Dependencies

Since `MARTY-1.6` the dependency installations are longer supported by the automated build procedure, it is the user responsibility to install the required dependencies on his/her particular system.

Library dependencies (needed at compile-time):
 - `Qt5` (needed for the `GRAFED` Graphical User Interface)
 - `GSL` + `GSLCBLAS` (C numerical scientific library)

System dependencies (needed at run-time as system commands):
 - `cmake`
 - `latex`
 - `lualatex`
 - `dvipng`
 - `convert` (part of `ImageMagick`)

 On `Ubuntu` for example these dependencies can be installed with
 ``` bash
    sudo apt-get install libgsl-dev libgslcblas0 texlive texlive-luatex dvipng coreutils -y
    sudo apt-get install qtbase5-dev qtchooser qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools -y
    sudo apt-get install cmake -y
 ```
 On `MacOS`
 ``` bash
    brew install coreutils gsl octave qt5 cmake imagemagick texlive
 ```

### Compilers for MARTY

MARTY links C++ code with Fortran code from the [LoopTools](http://www.feynarts.de/looptools/) library.
MARTY takes care of compiling and linking `LoopTools` but the compilers must be chosen carefully to link C++ and fortran codes.

For this reason, the MARTY installation procedure requires to have the GNU compiler collection, version greater than 7. Furthermore, the versions of `gcc/g++/gfortran` should be the same. The minimal set of compilers required to compile `MARTY` is therefore
```
    gcc-7
    g++-7
    gfortran-7
```

If the default compilers on the system do not meet the above requirements, compilers must be explicitely defined before going further following:
``` bash
    export CXX=g++-7
    export CC=gcc-7
    export FC=gfortran-7
```
Any version greater than 7 can be used but all the three compilers must use **the same version**.

### Build and install `MARTY`


Once the dependencies have been installed and that the `C`, `C++` and `Fortran` compilers meet the requirements above (either by default or after having exported the `CC`, `CXX` and `FC` environment variables), clone this repository:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/docbrown1955/marty-public.git
```
Then, build and install `MARTY`!
``` bash
    cd marty-public
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=<installation-path-for-marty>
    make
    make install
```

If the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is not given, `cmake` will automatically set this variable to `/usr/local`. In case the installation path is not in `/home` (on Unix systems), the installation command requires `sudo`:
``` bash
    sudo make install
```
### Run tests

To run the tests after installing `MARTY` simply type:
``` bash
    ctest
 ```

## Environment variables

In case `MARTY` is not installed in a standard location (not in `/usr/local/`) it is necessary to set properly environment variables. Given that the installation path is `<install/path>`, Linux users should add this in their `${HOME}/.bashrc` file:

``` bash
    export PATH=$PATH:<install/path>/bin
    export CPATH=$CPATH:<install/path>/include
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:<install/path>/include
    export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:<install/path>/lib
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:<install/path>/lib
```

Although not recommended, if MacOS users install MARTY in a non-standard location the appropriate environment variables are (also to put in `${HOME}/.bashrc`)

``` bash
    export PATH=$PATH:<install/path>/bin
    export CPATH=$CPATH:<install/path>/include
    export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:<install/path>/include
    export LIBRARY_PATH=$LIBRARY_PATH:<install/path>/lib
    export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:<install/path>/lib
```

After the first installation (and adding the environment variables in the `.bashrc` file) it is necessary to launch a new terminal or reload the bash session:

``` bash
   source ${HOME}/.bashrc
```

## The specific case of `MacOS`

On `MacOS` the System Integrity Protection (SIP) can cause issues if files are not installed in `/usr/local`. We therefore recommand to install `MARTY` in this location (default):
``` bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install
```

## In case of trouble installing `MARTY`

In you have issues to install dependencies or build `MARTY`, please see the open and closed [issues](https://github.com/docbrown1955/marty-public/issues). If not one solves your problem, open a new issue describing the bug:
 - Which operating system (including the version)
 - Provide a clear description of the procedure followed before the bug happened
 - Copy the error message if any
